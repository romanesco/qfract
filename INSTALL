QFract -- a Qt based fractal viewer

To build from the source code, you need Qt 4.5 (or later?).
Download it from http://qt.nokia.com/ and install.

You also need Boost C++ Libraries (http://www.boost.org/).

Supported platforms are:
- Mac OS X (10.4 or later),
- Windows (with MinGW),
- Linux, Mac OS X+X11, FreeBSD, etc. on X Window System.

To build on Windows + MinGW, you need dlfcn-win32.
(http://code.google.com/p/dlfcn-win32/)

Install instruction:

First unpack the archive as follows

$ tar zcvf qfract-??????.tar.gz
$ cd qfract4

and edit Makefile, config.h, plugins/Makefile to adjust your environment.
Then

$ make

to compile everything.

Warning: Do not run qmake by yourself. It will overwrite Makefile.

For recent Mac OS X, qmake create XCode project file, so open
Makefile.qmake.xcodeproj and build qfract by XCode.
Building by XCode is not enough to run qfract. Follow the instruction
below.

Under other environment than Mac OS X (Aqua) and Windows, just execute

$ ./qfract

to run the binary.
For Mac OS X (Aqua) and Windows, you also need to to the following after 
running make.


i) For Mac OS X, run

$ make install-mac

to copy necessary files into qfract-mac.app in order to make
an application bundle. qfract-mac.app can run well when it is moved to
other place.
If you want to build a universal binary, edit also qfract.pro.

ii) For Windows, run

$ make install-win

to copy necessary files into dist directory.
Then you can run dist/qfract.exe and dist directory can
be moved and renamed as you like.
Depending on the libraries, you might also need to put libraries
(of Qt, Boost, gcc, stdc++, etc.) in the same directory as
qfract.exe.

Have fun!
